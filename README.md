# Bhavesh Portfolio

A fast, animated, resume-driven portfolio site. Drop your resume data into `data.json` (or send me your PDF and I'll map it for you).

## Quick Start
1. **Edit** `data.json` with your details.
2. **Replace** `assets/profile.jpg` and `assets/resume.pdf` (optional).
3. **Open** `index.html` in any browser (no build step).

## Customization
- Colors and spacing are in `styles.css` (CSS variables at the top).
- The animated background and scroll reveals live in `script.js`.
- Sections auto-populate from `data.json`.
- Contact button uses a mailto link â€” change the email in `data.json` and `script.js` if needed.

## Deploy
- Drag & drop the folder into Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages.
- Set a custom domain and you're live.
